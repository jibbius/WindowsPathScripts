#Windows (UNIXie) path scripts

This is a **personal** collection of .bat files, that I use to make using the command line:
 - Replicate (some) functionality / aliases that already exist in unix.
 - Aliases that don't exist in unix, but are used by me frequently.
 - Command line utilities that I like.


 This repo is really for my own personal use only.
 You are welcome to download / borrow / take ideas from it.
